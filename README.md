# Advent of Code

I don't celebrate xmas but I do like coding challanges.

Writing the solutions in JavaScript first because that's what I know best and 
honestly no thanks to TypeScript for stuff like this. It's sorta nice
but I don't feel like setting it up.


## Rust

Planning on refactoring some of these in rust over the winter break and I hope to
start the new year with a better understanding of the basics of it.
